# Graffiti Incidents in February 2020

## Intepretation
The intention was to visualize graffiti incident per San Francisco police district for February 2020. Hovering over a district will outline it and display the number of incidents for that particular district.

Color scale used for this visualization is a threshold one.

## Data Wrangling

Data rollup performed by police districts, counting the incidents.

## Conclusions

My naive assumption before-hand was that the more 'well-off' neighborhoods would have higher levels of incidents. This was clearly a wrong bias.
